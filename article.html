						NASA is trying to squash conspiracy theories about the space station leak
					</h2>

					<h3>Downplaying rumors of sabotage</h3>

					<div class="imges"><img src="img/nasa.png"></div>
					<div class="articletext">
						<p>Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure leak occurred on the International Space Station, and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, are now trying to quell the rumors.</p>

						<p>In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space agency is working closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. The statement also notes that no information will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, despite rampant speculation in the Russian press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.</p>

						<p>During a teleconference yesterday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and Roscosmos general director Dmitry Rogozin “affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation,” according to the statement. “They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.”</p>

						<p>NASA and Roscosmos first detected a drop in the space station’s pressure around 7PM ET on Wednesday, August 29th, suspecting that there was a leak of some kind on the ISS. The air was escaping at such a slow rate, though, that flight controllers opted not to wake the crew. The next day, the six astronauts on board the ISS traced the leak to a small hole inside one of the two Russian Soyuz capsules docked to the space station — the vehicles used to bring crew to and from Earth. This particular Soyuz has been at the ISS since June 8th, and the hole was found in one of the modules that is jettisoned before the Soyuz enters Earth’s atmosphere during its descent. So the piece is not necessary for the entire trip back to the ground.</p>



						<p>The hole was successfully patched up on Thursday, August 30th, but the mystery over the origin of the hole has remained. The ideas of in-space sabotage were first suggested by Roscosmos, which formed a state commission to get to the bottom of the leak. After dismissing the theory of a micrometeoroid impact, Rogozin said it looked as if the hole had been made by a drill. (NASA allegedly published and then removed pictures of the hole, which did look as if it had been made by a drill of some kind.) Rogozin noted that Roscosmos would “find out whether it was an accidental defect or a deliberate spoilage and where it was done — either on Earth or in space,” according to a report in TASS.</p>

						<p>Russia has a noted history of blaming spacecraft failures on possible sabotage, so this kind of behavior isn’t new. However, the gossip over the leak seems to have only grown in the last couple of weeks. As first reported by Ars Technica, a story published in Russia’s Kommersant cited anonymous sources from Roscosmos, who claimed that investigators were looking into the possibility that the hole was caused by a NASA astronaut. The theory was that one of the three American crew members had gotten sick, so one of the astronauts caused the leak in order to force a quick evacuation to Earth.</p>

						In fact, the rumors have gotten so bad that ISS commander Drew Feustel actually had to flat-out deny that anyone on board the station was involved in some way. “I can unequivocally say that the crew had nothing to do with this on orbit, without a doubt, and I think it’s actually a shame and somewhat embarrassing that anybody is wasting any time talking about something that the crew was involved in,” Feustel said in an interview from space with ABC News, as reported by CBS.</p>


						<p>Despite having first floated the theory of sabotage, Rogozin has taken to criticizing journalists for speculating about the cause of the leak. “The recent gossip and rumors circulating about the incident at the ISS hinder the work of Roscosmos experts and are designed to subvert the friendly relations among the crew members of the space station,” Rogozin said on Facebook, according to a TASS report. “All statements citing unnamed sources are inadmissible until Roscosmos special commission concludes its work,” he added.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile, there is another, more plausible theory, that is still on the table: that the hole was made by a worker on the ground, who then hastily patched it up before the Soyuz launched on June 6th. Then somehow the patch was removed, exposing the hole. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said that faulty work on Earth has not been ruled out, TASS reports.</p>

						<p>In a previous statement on September 5th, Roscosmos said that it plans to finish its investigation this month. “All conclusions and decisions will be announced after the commission’s work is completed,” according to the corporation.</p>

						EU approves controversial Copyright Directive, including internet ‘link tax’ and ‘upload filter’
					</h2>

					<h3>Those in favor say they’re fighting for content creators, but critics say the new laws will be ‘catastrophic’</h3>

					<div class="imges"><img src="img/eu.png"></div>
					<div class="articletext">
						<p>The European Parliament has voted in favor of the Copyright Directive, a controversial piece of legislation intended to update online copyright laws for the internet age.</p>

						<p>The directive was originally rejected by MEPs in July following criticism of two key provisions: Articles 11 and 13, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter” by critics. However, in parliament this morning, an updated version of the directive was approved, along with amended versions of Articles 11 and 13. The final vote was 438 in favor and 226 against.</p>

						<p>The fallout from this decision will be far-reaching, and take a long time to settle. The directive itself still faces a final vote in January 2019 (although experts say it’s unlikely it will be rejected). After that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the directive’s text.</p>

						<p>The most important parts of this are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 is intended to give publishers and papers a way to make money when companies like Google link to their stories, allowing them to demand paid licenses. Article 13 requires certain platforms like YouTube and Facebook stop users sharing unlicensed copyrighted material.</p>

						<p>Critics of the Copyright Directive say these provisions are disastrous. In the case of Article 11, they note that attempts to “tax” platforms like Google News for sharing articles have repeatedly failed, and that the system would be ripe to abuse by copyright trolls.</p>

						<p>Article 13, they say, is even worse. The legislation requires that platforms proactively work with rightsholders to stop users uploading copyrighted content. The only way to do so would be to scan all data being uploaded to sites like YouTube and Facebook. This would create an incredible burden for small platforms, and could be used as a mechanism for widespread censorship. This is why figures like Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee came out so strongly against the directive.</p>


						<p>However, those backing these provisions say the arguments above are the result of scaremongering by big US tech companies, eager to keep control of the web’s biggest platforms. They point to existing laws and amendments to the directive as proof it won’t be abused in this way. These include exemptions for sites like GitHub and Wikipedia from Article 13, and exceptions to the “link tax” that allow for the sharing of mere hyperlinks and “individual words” describing articles without constraint.</p>


						<p>In remarks following the vote in Parliament this morning, MEP Axel Voss, who has led the charge on Articles 11 and 13, thanked his fellow politicians “for the job we have done together.” “This is a good sign for the creative industries in Europe,” said Voss. Opposing MEPs like Julia Reda of the Pirate Party described the outcome as “catastrophic.”</p>

						<p>Despite these disagreements, what’s clear is that if the Copyright Directive receives final approval by the European Parliament in January, it will have a huge, disruptive impact on the internet, both in the European Union and around the world. Exactly how the legislation will be interpreted will be up to individual nations, but the shift in the balance of power is clear: the web’s biggest tech companies are losing their grip on the internet.</p>

					<h2>
						Jeff Bezos is going to create schools where ‘the child is the customer’
					</h2>


					<div class="imges"><img src="img/jeff.png"></div>
					<div class="articletext">
						<p>A year after asking for suggestions on philanthropy, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is unveiling his first projects. The highlight will be the creation of a network for nonprofit preschools that are to be built in low-income communities and accept students at no charge.</p>

						<p>Bezos also intends to fund existing nonprofits that help homeless families by providing access to housing and food. Both initiatives will be overseen by something he’s calling the Bezos Day One Fund, which he’s committing $2 billion toward.</p>

						<p>Each of the initiatives will have a specific group behind it: the Day 1 Families Fund and the Day 1 Academies Fund. The Families Fund will issue grants on a yearly basis to organizations doing “needle-moving work.” The Academies Fund will be in charge of launching and operating a network of schools entirely on its own. Bezos says they’ll be “high-quality” Montessori-inspired schools that offer “full scholarship,” seemingly to all students.</p>

						<p>Bezos says he wants to directly control the schools’ operation so that they can be run like Amazon and adopt Amazon’s principles. “Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession,” he writes. “The child will be the customer.”</p>

						<p>The initiative was announced in a note posted on Twitter. In the note, Bezos didn’t say how far along any of this was or when either initiative would get started. “Day One” is supposed to be a phrase about staying in a startup mindset, but it also seems like it may literally be day one for these ventures.</p>
